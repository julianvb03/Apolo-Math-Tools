# Apolo-Math-Tools
This repository contains the source code for several numerical methods implementation, using HPC frameworks and tools, like OpenMP and MPI.

## TODO
If you are developing blindly, without any tool guidance, you are doing C++ wrong. Think of these tools like a backup camera in your car. Certainly you can back up without a camera, but having one gives you a second set of eyes, deeper into the action than is possible with your human eyes.

You need:

Continuous build environment

github
gitlab
jenkins
<what's your favorite, did I leave it out?>
As many compilers as you can

GCC
Clang
cl (visual studio)
clang-cl (clang's msvc compatibility)
An organized testing framework

doctest
catch
gtest
boosttest
<what's your favorite, did I leave it out?>
test coverage analysis, reporting and tracking (you need to know if your test rate is decreasing!)

coveralls
codecov
<what else am I missing here?>
As much static analysis as you can (most are free or have free options)

at least -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wconversion -Wpedantic -Werror and -W4 on Windows
gcc -fanalyzer - https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html
cl.exe /analyze
cppcheck
clang-tidy
pvs studio https://pvs-studio.com/en/
sonar's tools
<countless many options, I expect many of you to tell me that I'm missing old school c tools, but many of those don't work with C++>
Runtime analysis during testing

address sanitizer (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html)
undefined behavior sanitizer
thread sanitizer
valgrind (if you can tolerate it)
debug checked iterators https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/debug_mode_using.html#debug_mode.using.mode https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/checked-iterators?view=msvc-170
drmemory
Fuzz Testing

More on this coming, but every library should be fuzz tested
It generates novel / unique inputs for your library in an attempt to generate 100% code coverage
Should be used in conjunction with runtime analysis, to hard-catch any bug

Using an IDE or plugin for your IDE can help integrate many of these things as well.
